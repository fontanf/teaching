\maketitle

For each problem considered, instances and a code skeleton containing an instance parser and a solution checker are provided in the \texttt{data/} and \texttt{python/} folders of the project.

The algorithms must be implemented in the provided files between the tags \texttt{TODO START} and \texttt{TODO END}.

They must be tested on all the provided instances with the command:
\texttt{python3 problem.py -i instance.json -c certificate.json}

And each solution file must be validated by the provided checker:
\texttt{python3 problem.py -a checker -i instance.json -c certificate.json}

The results must be reproducible.

\bigskip

The delivrable must contain:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A \emph{short} report describing and justifying the proposed algorithms
  \item The code implementing the algorithms
  \item The solution files obtained on the provided instances
\end{itemize}

\section{Dynamic Programming}

We consider the Knapsack problem with width:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $n$ items; for each item $j = 1, \dots, n$
        \begin{itemize}
          \item a weight $w_j \in \N^+$
          \item a width $l_j \in \N^+$
          \item a profit $p_j \in \N^+$
        \end{itemize}
      \item a capacity $C \in \N^+$
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: select a subset of items such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item the total weight of the selected items does not exceed the knapsack capacity
    \end{itemize}
  \item Objective: maximize the total profit of the selected items minus the maximum width among the selected items
\end{itemize}

Propose and implement an algorithm based on Dynamic Programming for this problem.

\section{Heuristic Tree Search}

We consider the Knapsack problem with width and conflicts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $n$ items; for each item $j = 1, \dots, n$
        \begin{itemize}
          \item a weight $w_j \in \N^+$
          \item a width $l_j \in \N^+$
          \item a profit $p_j \in \N^+$
        \end{itemize}
      \item a capacity $C \in \N^+$
      \item a graph $G$ such that each node corresponds to an item
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: select a subset of items such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item the total weight of the selected items does not exceed the knapsack capacity
      \item if there exists an edge between vertex $j_1$ and $j_2$ in $G$, then item $j_1$ and item $j_2$ must not be both selected
    \end{itemize}
  \item Objective: maximize the total profit of the selected items minus the maximum width among the selected items
\end{itemize}

Propose and implement an algorithm based on Heuristic Tree Search with Dynamic Programming for this problem.

\section{Column Generation \\ + Dynamic Programming}

We consider the Single machine batch scheduling problem with Makespan objective:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $n$ jobs; for each job $j = 1, \dots, n$, a processing time $p_j \in \N^+$ and a size $s_j \in \N^+$
      \item a batch capacity $Q \in \N^+$
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: partition the jobs into batches and sequence the batches such that:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item each job must be in exactly one of the batches
      \item the processing time of a batch is equal to the longest processing time among all jobs it contains
      \item the total size of the jobs in a batch does not exceed its capacity
    \end{itemize}
  \item Objective: minimize the makespan of the schedule
\end{itemize}

Propose an exponential formulation and implement an algorithm based on a Column Generation heuristic for this problem.
