\maketitle

For each problem considered, instances and a code skeleton containing an instance parser and a solution checker are provided in the \texttt{data/} and \texttt{python/} folders of the project.

The algorithms must be implemented in the provided files between the tags \texttt{TODO START} and \texttt{TODO END}.

They must be tested on all the provided instances with the command:
\texttt{python3 problem.py -i instance.json -c certificate.json}

And each solution file must be validated by the provided checker:
\texttt{python3 problem.py -a checker -i instance.json -c certificate.json}

The results must be reproducible.

\bigskip

The delivrable must contain:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A \emph{short} report describing and justifying the proposed algorithms
  \item The code implementing the algorithms
  \item The solution files obtained on the provided instances
\end{itemize}

\section{Dynamic Programming}

We consider the Single machine order acceptance and scheduling problem with objective Total tardiness:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $n$ jobs with ($j = 1, \dots, n$)
        \begin{itemize}
          \item processing time $p_j \in \N^+$
          \item due date $d_j \in \N^+$
          \item profit $v_j \in \N^+$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: find a sub-sequence of jobs
  \item Objective: maximize the total profit minus the total tardiness of the scheduled job
\end{itemize}

For a job $j$ starting at $s$, its tardiness is equal to:
\begin{displaymath}
  T_j = \max \left\{ 0, (s + p_j) - d_j \right\}
\end{displaymath}

Propose and implement an algorithm based on Dynamic Programming for this problem.

\section{Heuristic Tree Search}

We consider the Single machine order acceptance and scheduling problem with objective Total weighted tardiness:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $n$ jobs with ($j = 1, \dots, n$)
        \begin{itemize}
          \item processing time $p_j \in \N^+$
          \item due date $d_j \in \N^+$
          \item profit $v_j \in \N^+$
          \item weight $w_j \in \N^+$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: find a sub-sequence of jobs
  \item Objective: maximize the total profit minus the total weighted tardiness of the scheduled job
\end{itemize}

For a job $j$ starting at $s$, its weighted tardiness is equal to $w_j T_j$.

Propose and implement an algorithm based on Heuristic Tree Search with Dynamic Programming for this problem.

\section{Column Generation \\ + Dynamic Programming}

We consider the Unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with objective Total tardiness:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $m$ machines
      \item $n$ jobs with ($j = 1, \dots, n$)
        \begin{itemize}
          \item processing time $p_j^i \in \N^+$ for each machine $i = 1, \dots, m$
          \item due date $d_j \in \N^+$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: find a schedule for each machine such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item each job is scheduled exactly once
    \end{itemize}
  \item Objective: minimize the total tardiness of the schedule
\end{itemize}

Propose an exponential formulation and implement an algorithm based on a Column Generation heuristic for this problem.
