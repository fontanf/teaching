\section*{Introduction}

The nurse rostering problem is the problem of assigning nurses to shifts to create a roster satisfying some predetermined requirements.

A day is composed of three types of work shifts: the early shift, the late shift and the night shift. For each shift of each day of the scheduling horizon, a number of nurses is requested. The goal is to find a schedule for each nurse such that these requirements and the other constraints are satisfied, while minimizing the number of nurses.

\section{Dynamic Programming}

We consider the following shift selection problem:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $n$ days; for each day $j = 1, \dots, n$, for each shift type $t = 1, 2, 3$, a profit $p_{j, t}$
      \item a maximum work time $c$
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: find a set of shifts such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item at most one shift is selected each day
      \item the night shift of a day and the early shift of the next day are not both selected
      \item at most $c$ shifts are selected
    \end{itemize}
  \item Objective: maximize the profit of the selected shifts
\end{itemize}

Propose and implement an algorithm based on Dynamic Programming for this problem.

\section{Heuristic Tree Search}

We consider the following shift selection problem including the constraint \say{Maximum numbers of shifts of each type}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $n$ days; for each day $j = 1, \dots, n$, for each shift type $t = 1, 2, 3$, a profit $p_{j, t}$
      \item a maximum work time $c$
      \item \textbf{for each shift type $t = 1, 2, 3$, a maximum number of shifts of this type $m_t$}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: find a set of shifts such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item at most one shift is selected each day
      \item the night shift of a day and the early shift of the next day are not both selected
      \item at most $c$ shifts are selected
      \item \textbf{at most $m_t$ shifts of a type $t$ are selected}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Objective: maximize the profit of the selected shifts
\end{itemize}

Propose and implement an algorithm based on Heuristic Tree Search with Dynamic Programming for this problem.

\section{Column Generation \\ + Dynamic Programming}

We consider the following nurse rostering problem including the constraint:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $n$ days; for each day $j = 1, \dots, n$, for each shift type $t = 1, 2, 3$, a requested number of nurses $s_{j, t}$
      \item a maximum work time $c$
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: for each nurse, find an assignment of shifts such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $s_{j, t}$ nurses are assigned to shift $t$ of day $j$
      \item a nurse is assigned at most one shift each day
      \item a nurse is not assigned the night shift of a day and the early shift of the next day
      \item a nurse is not assigned more than $c$ shifts
    \end{itemize}
  \item Objective: minimize the number of nurses
\end{itemize}

Propose an exponential formulation and implement an algorithm based on a Column Generation heuristic for this problem.

\section{Column Generation \\ + Heuristic Tree Search}

We consider the following nurse rostering problem including the constraint \say{Maximum numbers of shifts of each type that can be assigned to nurses}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $n$ days; for each day $j = 1, \dots, n$, for each shift type $t = 1, 2, 3$, a requested number of nurses $s_{j, t}$
      \item a maximum work time $c$
      \item \textbf{for each shift type $t = 1, 2, 3$, a maximum number of shifts of this type $m_t$}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: for each nurse, find an assignment of shifts such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $s_{j, t}$ nurses are assigned to shift $t$ of day $j$
      \item a nurse is assigned at most one shift each day
      \item a nurse is not assigned the night shift of a day and the early shift of the next day
      \item a nurse is not assigned more than $c$ shifts
      \item \textbf{a nurse is not assigned more than $m_t$ shifts of a type $t$}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Objective: minimize the number of nurses
\end{itemize}
