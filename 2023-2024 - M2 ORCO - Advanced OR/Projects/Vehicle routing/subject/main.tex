\maketitle

For each problem considered, instances and a code skeleton containing an instance parser and a solution checker are provided in the \texttt{data/} and \texttt{python/} folders of the project.

The algorithms must be implemented in the provided files between the tags \texttt{TODO START} and \texttt{TODO END}.

They must be tested on all the provided instances with the command:
\texttt{python3 problem.py -i instance.json -c certificate.json}

And each solution file must be validated by the provided checker:
\texttt{python3 problem.py -a checker -i instance.json -c certificate.json}

The results must be reproducible.

\bigskip

The delivrable must contain:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A \emph{short} report describing and justifying the proposed algorithms
  \item The code implementing the algorithms
  \item The solution files obtained on the provided instances
\end{itemize}

\section{Dynamic Programming}

We consider the Elementary shortest path problem with resource constraint and a single slot:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $1$ depot
      \item $n - 1$ customers; for each customer $j = 2, \dots, n$, a visit interval $\interval[open right]{s_j}{e_j}$, $s_j \in \N_+$, $e_j \in \N_+$, $s_j < e_j$
      \item an $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $t$ specifying the times in $\R_+$ to travel between each pair of locations
      \item an $n \times n$ matrix $c$ specifying the costs in $\R$ to travel between each pair of locations
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: find a sub-tour starting and ending at the depot such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item each customer is visited at most once
      \item the arrival at a customer $j$ is before $s_j$
      \item the departure from a customer is at $e_j$ (even if the arrival was before $s_j$)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Objective: minimize the cost of the sub-tour
\end{itemize}

Note that the costs might be negative.

Propose and implement an algorithm based on Dynamic Programming for this problem.

\section{Heuristic Tree Search}

We consider the Elementary shortest path problem with resource constraint and two slots:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $1$ depot
      \item $n - 1$ customers; for each customer $j = 2, \dots, n$, two visit intervals (which might overlap)
        \begin{itemize}
          \item $\interval[open right]{s_j^1}{e_j^1}$, $s_j^1 \in \N_+$, $e_j^1 \in \N_+$, $s_j^1 < e_j^2$
          \item $\interval[open right]{s_j^2}{e_j^2}$, $s_j^2 \in \N_+$, $e_j^2 \in \N_+$, $s_j^2 < e_j^2$
        \end{itemize}
      \item an $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $t$ specifying the times in $\R_+$ to travel between each pair of locations
      \item an $n \times n$ matrix $c$ specifying the costs in $\R$ to travel between each pair of locations
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: find a sub-tour starting and ending at the depot such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item each customer is visited at most once
      \item the arrival and the departure from a customer include one of its two visit intervals
    \end{itemize}
  \item Objective: minimize the cost of the sub-tour
\end{itemize}

Propose and implement an algorithm based on Heuristic Tree Search with Dynamic Programming for this problem.

\section{Column Generation \\ + Dynamic Programming}

We consider the Vehicle routing problem with a single slot:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $1$ depot
      \item $n - 1$ customers; for each customer $j = 2, \dots, n$, a visit interval $\interval[open right]{s_j}{e_j}$, $s_j \in \N_+$, $e_j \in \N_+$, $s_j < e_j$
      \item an $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $t$ specifying the times in $\R_+$ to travel between each pair of locations
    \end{itemize}
  \item Problem: find a set of routes starting and ending at the depot such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item each customer is visited exactly once
      \item the arrival at a customer $j$ is before $s_j$
      \item the departure from a customer is at $e_j$ (even if the arrival was before $s_j$)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Objective: minimize the total traveled distance
\end{itemize}

Propose an exponential formulation and implement an algorithm based on a Column Generation heuristic for this problem.
